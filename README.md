Android Bluetooth Application
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an Android application using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture with Jetpack Compose for the UI, Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, and Android's Bluetooth APIs for managing Bluetooth connections and data transmission.
Key Features

    Bluetooth Discovery: Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
    Bluetooth Management: Enable/disable Bluetooth and make the device discoverable.
    MVVM Architecture: Organizes the codebase with a clear separation of concerns.
    Jetpack Compose: Modern declarative UI toolkit used to build the interface.
    Dagger-Hilt: Provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 or newer
    Kotlin plugin compatible with your Android Studio version
    An Android device or emulator with Bluetooth capabilities

Setup

    Clone the Repository

    Clone this repository to your local machine using Android Studio or your preferred Git tools.

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/jackbelding1/android-bluetooth.git

    Open the Project in Android Studio

    Open Android Studio, select "Open an Existing Project," and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

    Sync Gradle

    Allow Android Studio to sync the project with Gradle files. This process might take a few moments.

    Configure an Emulator or Connect a Device

    Set up an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to run the application. Ensure the device or emulator has Bluetooth capabilities.

Running the Application

    Enable Bluetooth & Permissions

    When running the app for the first time, you will be prompted to enable Bluetooth and grant necessary permissions (e.g., location permissions for Bluetooth discovery).

    Discover Devices

    Use the app's interface to discover nearby Bluetooth devices. Make sure other devices are discoverable.

    Manage Connections

    The application allows enabling/disabling Bluetooth and making your device discoverable to others.

Architecture & Libraries

    MVVM Architecture: Utilizes ViewModel components to separate UI logic from business logic, promoting a more maintainable and testable codebase.
    Jetpack Compose: Simplifies UI development with a modern, declarative approach.
    Dagger-Hilt: Simplifies dependency injection, automatically handling component lifecycles.
    Android Bluetooth API: Manages Bluetooth operations, including scanning for devices, connecting, and data transmission.
